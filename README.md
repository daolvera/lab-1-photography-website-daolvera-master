# Photo Website
Multiple HTML and CSS pages to showcase a photo website
* A responsive Bootstrap menu that appears on all pages.

* A footer that appears on all pages, which includes the URL to your
  GitHub repository on GitHub classroom. This should be a private
  repository that only you and the TAs can access.

* A home page that introduces the viewer to the photographer.

* A portfolio page that showcases 9 or 10 images from the
  photographer, using the Bootstrap grid, the CSS Grid, a masonry CSS
  layout, or some other technology to arrange the photos.

* A reviews page that lists reviews from customers, each in a separate
  paragraph and using styles to separate them (white space, lines,
  etc.).

* An about page that includes a photo of the photographer and tells the
  visitor a little about him or her.
